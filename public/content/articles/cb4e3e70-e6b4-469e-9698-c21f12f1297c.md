A quick, family-friendly guide to the giants of prehistory!

## 1. Argentinosaurus

Often regarded as the largest land animal ever, _Argentinosaurus_ lived ~96 million years ago in Argentina. Estimates: **30–35 m (98–115 ft)** long, **65–80 t** weight.

## 2. Supersaurus

A North American sauropod reaching up to **42 m (135 ft)** long and ~**40 t** in weight. Its nickname “super lizard” comes from its astonishing neck length.

## 3. Maraapunisaurus

A Jurassic giant known from just a vertebra. Some claim it was **~58 m (190 ft)** long—but evidence is limited.

## 4. Bruhathkayosaurus

From India, based on fragmentary fossils. Estimates: **~35 m (115 ft)** long and possibly **150–170 t**—though the actual remains have deteriorated.

## 5. Patagotitan

Found in Argentina. Measured **~37.5 m (123 ft)** long and weighed about **77 t**.

## 6. Puertasaurus

Another Argentine titan—**30 m (98 ft)** long and **50 t**, based on a few giant bones.

## 7. Dreadnoughtus

Known from a well-preserved skeleton (~70%). Weighs **~65 t**, often featured in museum exhibits.

## 8. Diplodocus hallorum

Once estimated at **35 m (115 ft)**, revised to about **30 m (100 ft)**, weighing **20–40 t**.

## 9. Barosaurus (giant specimen)

A vertebra suggested a **49 m (160 ft)** creature, though full animals were around **27 m (90 ft)** long.

## 10. Spinosaurus _(largest carnivore)_

The biggest meat-eater: **15–16 m (50–54 ft)** long and **7–10 t** in weight, with a distinctive sail-back and semi-aquatic lifestyle.

## 🌍 Why sizes differ

- Most giants are known from **incomplete fossils**—size is extrapolated.
- Some are based on **fragmentary or lost remains**, so estimates change.

---

## 🌱 Feeding & lifestyle

- **Sauropods** (like Argentinosaurus) were herbivores, using long necks to feed from low plants to treetops.
- **Carnivores** (like Spinosaurus) hunted both fish and small dinosaurs, sometimes entering water.

### ✅ Final thoughts

These creatures spark imagination—some estimates are debated, and new fossils can shake up the rankings. Still, they were among the most amazing organisms to ever walk the Earth.
