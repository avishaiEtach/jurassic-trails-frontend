Dinosaurs didn’t just roam the Earth — they adapted to it. From towering mountains to lush forests, nature played a huge role in shaping how dinosaurs lived, moved, and survived. Let’s explore how the natural world influenced these ancient creatures.

## Landscapes That Molded Giants

The environment determined everything: where dinosaurs lived, what they ate, and how they behaved. In dry deserts, dinosaurs like _Psittacosaurus_ developed tough skin and burrowing habits. In dense forests, smaller species used camouflage to hide from predators.

## Weather and Climate: A Prehistoric Challenge

Nature wasn’t always kind. Shifting climates meant dinosaurs had to adapt or perish. During warmer periods, lush vegetation supported massive herbivores like _Diplodocus_. But colder snaps may have pushed species to migrate or evolve insulating features like feathers.

## Natural Disasters: Survival of the Smartest

Volcanoes, floods, and asteroid impacts were part of life. Dinosaurs that could sense danger or move quickly had better chances of survival. Fossil evidence shows some species may have changed habitats to escape environmental threats.

## Nature’s Influence on Evolution

Over millions of years, nature sculpted dinosaurs into an incredible variety of shapes and sizes. From the long necks of _Brachiosaurus_ to the sharp claws of _Therizinosaurus_, every feature had a purpose — shaped by the world around them.
