The **Mesozoic Era**, often called the _Age of Dinosaurs_, spanned roughly **180 million years**, from about **252 million to 66 million years ago**. It was a dynamic period marked by dramatic shifts in climate, geography, and life on Earth.

## The Three Periods of the Mesozoic

### Triassic (252â€“201 million years ago)

The Triassic began after the largest mass extinction in Earth's history. Life slowly recovered, leading to the rise of the first dinosaurs and mammals. Early dinosaurs like _Eoraptor_ were small and agile.

### Jurassic (201â€“145 million years ago)

The Jurassic saw dinosaurs diversify and dominate. Huge sauropods like _Brachiosaurus_ and armored dinosaurs like _Stegosaurus_ roamed lush forests. Pterosaurs ruled the skies, and the first birds appeared.

### Cretaceous (145â€“66 million years ago)

Flowering plants evolved rapidly, changing ecosystems. Iconic dinosaurs like _Triceratops_ and _Tyrannosaurus rex_ thrived. Toward the end of this period, a massive asteroid impact led to the extinction of most dinosaur species.

## Why Did Dinosaurs Thrive?

Dinosaurs were incredibly diverse and adaptable. Their upright stance, varied diets, and efficient respiratory systems helped them dominate land ecosystems for over 160 million years.

> ðŸ¦– **Fun Fact:** Some theropod dinosaurs evolved feathers, and birds are direct descendants of these feathered dinosaurs.

## The End of the Mesozoic

About **66 million years ago**, a massive asteroid struck near what is now the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula in Mexico. This event triggered wildfires, tsunamis, and a "nuclear winter" effect, dramatically cooling the planet and collapsing ecosystems. Roughly **75% of all species** went extinct, marking the end of the dinosaurs (except for their bird descendants).

## Legacy of the Dinosaurs

Today, dinosaurs continue to captivate our imagination. Modern birds carry their legacy, and fossils teach us about evolution, climate change, and resilience of life on Earth.
